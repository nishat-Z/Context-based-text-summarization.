# Context-based-text-summarization.
Context-based custom model for summarized text extraction.
This project utilizes NLP techniques to summarize the text data from each document contained in large data corpus by finding the context between given keywords and given commodities. You need to define a window size within which the contextual relationship between the keyword and commodity need to be found in the message in both the directions. Also define a radius around the commodity for better understanding of the context.
